## ***Module 1 Start***

**Video - 1  MOTIVATION**

What I learned - 

1. Langgraph helps in bending the reliability curve by giving higher reliability for same amount of agent control.
2. Pillars of Langgraph that include Persistence, Streaming, Human-in-the-loop, Controllability.
3. What is Control Flow and an idea of what happens when LLM is injected in it.



**Video - 2  SIMPLE GRAPH**

What I learned - 

1.	What are edges , nodes, states in a graph
2.	What is Graph Construction and the components of it like the StateGraph function and adding nodes
3.	Graph invocation using invoke and what it means for a graph to run synchronously.

Changes I made-
1.	Altered the prompts in the code.
2.	Altered the weight for nodes in the code.
3.	Created a new graph at the end with 3 nodes.
