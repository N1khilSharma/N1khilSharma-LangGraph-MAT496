## ***Module 1 Start***

**Video - 1  MOTIVATION**

What I learned - 

1. Langgraph helps in bending the reliability curve by giving higher reliability for same amount of agent control.
2. Pillars of Langgraph that include Persistence, Streaming, Human-in-the-loop, Controllability.
3. What is Control Flow and an idea of what happens when LLM is injected in it.



**Video - 2  SIMPLE GRAPH**

What I learned - 

1.	What are edges , nodes, states in a graph
2.	What is Graph Construction and the components of it like the StateGraph function and adding nodes
3.	Graph invocation using invoke and what it means for a graph to run synchronously.

Changes I made-
1.	Altered the prompts in the code.
2.	Altered the weight for nodes in the code.
3.	Created a new graph at the end with 3 nodes.

**Video - 3  Langsmith Studio**

What I learned - 

1.	Interacting with the Langgraph ide in studio.
2.	Tracking the run of the graph in studio using Threads.



**Video - 4  CHAIN**

What I learned - 

1.	What are Chains in Langgraph and how they bind tools.
2.	What are messages, types of messages in Langgraph and that chat models interact using messages.
3.	What are tools and how to do tool calls on chat models. 
4.	Using messages as GraphStates.

Changes I made-
1.	Altered the prompts in the code.
2.	Created a graph at the end which performs tool calls and uses message as GraphState to perform arithmetic operations.
